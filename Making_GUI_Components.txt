Making Components in our GUI:

1) What type of component are you making?
- Panel (uipanel)
- Button (uicontrol)
- Static text (uicontrol)
- Editable text (uicontrol)
- File menu (uimenu)

2) Create component with all required data - use examples in GUI. (make sure to create componenent in the correct section!!! Sections are separated by 3 commented-out lines!!! - Most are already defined)

3) Add component to data.handles object. [even if it isn't technically necessary]

4) Create callback - add case to desired callback function (MenuCallback, ButtonCallback, etc.)

5) Test your component many times to make sure it's working properly :D
